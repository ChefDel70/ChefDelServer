This is my first Sinatra server!

Sinatra is a DSL service that allows the creation of web apps and basic
websites in ruby.

There were a few gems that we used to make this possible.

Nokogiri is a gem in ruby that is an HTML/XML parser.  
It also assists in he ability to search documents via the CSS selector.

We also used HTTParty that allows Ruby to work together.
It queries the web services, and examines the return.
